## Welcome to the CapStone Project!


Hi! **Team**. Please this is the **github** repository in which we would be building our **project**.

We are all going to work on parts on the project and submit to this repository.

**Please do well to follow these instructions.**

## Making a pull request

[Follow this link to learn how to make a copy on your machine and also make a pull request after you're done with your task](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/).

## Running the application

- Navigate to the project directory
  ` $ cd capstone_project/`
- Install all needed dependencies
  `$ npm install`
- Start the application
  `$ npm start`

## Working on your task

- Work on the part you're supposed to work on.
- Provide readable and understandable comments.
- Update the Readme file with a short documentation on your task.
  > eg.
  > Name: DAVID ADU-POKU
  > ` <Button>Click Me</Button>`
  > This component does the function . . .
- Test it in your browser since we've not been taught how to write tests(Learn to write tests in JavaScript for future projects).

## Submission

- After making a pull request the whole team will review your code and decide to accept it or not.
- When accepted, I will follow suit and merge it with the project.

## Article

[Link to the article](https://medium.com/@amanuelabiy.as/sidehustle-capstone-project-1-react-js-5865afbd0ec3).

## Hosting

- Each of us will clone and host the projects on our own

      It is a good exercise to learn how to host react projects.

## If I left anything out you can suggest it in the group or make the changes in your copy of the project.


## Code Documentation

### Name: Victor Oluwayemi
- The Body Component
 >The project requirement was to replace the Google logo with the Sidehustle logo and update the logo with the user input >in the search bar. Initially, the Sidehustle logo is displayed, but when a user inputs some text into the search bar, >react updates the state of the logo with the inputed text.
     
 >A functional component and the **useState** hook was used to accomplish this task.
